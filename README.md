# ChemE-Scheduling
Code for scheduling visitor-faculty meetings during the MIT ChemE Recruiting Weekend

## Using the Code for the First Time
1.  Go to www.juliabox.com.  Everything that follows in the instructions below will be done there. Use GitHub (this website) only to consult these instructions.
2.  Sign in via LinkedIn, GitHub, or Google.
3.  Clone this repository from GitHub.
    - Click the **Git** icon in the top banner of the screen.
    - In the **Git Clone URL** field, copy the following URL: https://github.com/gdowdy3/ChemE-Scheduling.git
    - Press the [Tab] key and the other two fields should be populated automatically with **Branch: master** and **JuliaBox Folder: ChemE-Scheduling**.
    - Click the "+" symbol to the right of the now filled fields.
    - Wait for confirmation of a successful "Git Operation".
    - Close out of the **Sync** pop-up.
4. Test run the code
    - Click on the **ChemE-Scheduling** folder.
    - Click on the **ChemE-Scheduling.ipnyb** file.  It should open in a new tab in your browser.
    - Follow the instructions there.
5. Inspect the output.
    - If the code ran successfully, it should have produced two files in the Y2Y-Scheduling Folder:
      - "Shift Focused Output.csv"
      - "Volunteer Focused Output.csv"
    - Save these files to your computer.
      - Check the box next to the first file.
      - Click the **Download** button that appears above when you do so.
      - Save it to a convenient location.
      - Repeat for the second file.
   - Open the files using Excel and manipulate them as you see fit (e.g., resizing and renaming columns).
   
   
## Using the Code with Your Own Input Data
To use the code with your own input data, you just need to provide your own "Individual Preferences.csv" and "Prefilled  Shifts.csv" files.  To do so:
1. Using Excel, create your own "Individual Preferences.csv" and "Prefilled  Shifts.csv" files, using the provided files as examples for the required format of the data.
   - These files must be named exactly "Individual Preferences.csv" and "Prefilled  Shifts.csv"!
   - Their formatting must be exactly the same as the provided sample files!
2. In JuliaBox, navigate to the Y2Y-Scheduling folder.
3. Click the **Upload** button in the top right corner of the screen.
4. In the pop-up window, find and select the first file you want to upload, and click the **Open** button.
5. Repeat steps 3. and 4. for the second file.
6. Click the blue **Upload** buttons next to each file.
7. Overwrite any pre-existing files of the same.
8. Run the code, as in step 4. of the previous section.
